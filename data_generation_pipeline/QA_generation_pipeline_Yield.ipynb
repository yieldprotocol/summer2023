By buying or selling fyTokens, users can synthetically lend or borrow the target asset for a ﬁxed term. fyTokens are fungible and trade at a ﬂoating price, which means their “interest rates” are determined by the market. The prices of fyTokens of varying maturities can be used to infer interest rates, and even to construct a yield curve. Depending on the target asset, fyTokens can settle through “cash-settlement” using an on-chain price oracle, through “physical settlement” in the target ERC20 token, or by synthetically is- suing or borrowing the target ERC20 token on another platform.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Yield Protocol is a standard for a token that settles based on the value of a target asset on a speciﬁed future date, and which is backed by some quantity of a collateral asset. We call these tokens fyTokens,1 or “ﬁxed yield tokens.”\n\nYou can create fyTokens by depositing collateral, then sell them to eﬀectively borrow (and short) the target asset. Buying fyTokens is economically similar to lending the target asset. The eﬀective “interest rate” received by fyToken holders is determined by the discount at which fyTokens currently trade, as well as the time to maturity.\n\nfyTokens can also be used as a building block for more sophisticated prod- ucts. While each maturity of fyTokens has a ﬁxed expiration date, you could\n\n1This nomenclature is inspired by the “cTokens” used in the Compound Protocol [1].\n\nPreviously released versions of this paper used the term “yTokens.”\n\n1"

These implied yields could be used to settle on-chain interest rate derivatives, to inform Maker’s choice of stability fee, or as an input to the in- terest rate formulas used by Compound or dYdX. By charting those yields for diﬀerent maturities, we can even construct a yield curve, which could be a useful indicator of the expected path of interest rates or prices.\n\nThis paper will present three constructions of fyTokens. The ﬁrst (“cash settlement”) assumes the existence of a price oracle that, when asked, can tell the contract the value of the target asset in terms of the collateral asset. The second (“physical settlement”) does not require any price oracle, but assumes that the target asset is itself a token (rather than an oﬀ-chain asset like USD). The third (settlement to synthetics) assumes that the target asset is either a collateralized synthetic like Maker, or supported by a ﬂoating-rate lending platform like Compound.\n\n2 Prior work\n\nThe design of the Yield Protocol is heavily inﬂuenced by other projects on the Ethereum blockchain that oﬀer synthetics, borrowing, lending, and/or leverage. Yield primarily diﬀers in that its interest rates are implicit and set by market prices, rather than being set by governance or a formula. Additionally, whereas most lending protocols use ﬂoating interest rates, Yield enables term loans with ﬁxed interest rates, while still maintaining some degree of fungibility. Section 4.3 shows how, thanks to these properties, the Yield Protocol can provide unique insight into the term structure of interest rates for on-chain lending."

These synthetics are supposed to trade at parity with the target asset (which often necessitates some kind of interest rate, usually set by governance or agreement of the parties involved). By contrast, fyToken prices are expected to ﬂoat, and the interest rate is implied by the discount at which they trade. Also, unlike most of these synthetics, fyTokens have an expiration date.\n\nSystems for on-chain lending or margin trading, such as Compound [1], Ful- crum [6], and dYdX [7], allow users to deposit assets to be lent out for interest, and/or as collateral for their own borrowing. These protocols oﬀer ﬂoating “overnight” interest rates determined by a formula, and positions can be with- drawn at any time. By contrast, Yield’s interest rates are determined by the market price of fyTokens. Holders earn a predictable interest rate if they hold their fyTokens to term, but “withdrawing” early requires selling fyTokens on the market, and thus might incur a loss.\n\nAn early iteration of Dharma [8] was a secured lending platform that al-\n\n2\n\nlowed users to enter into collateralized loans with a ﬁxed term and interest rate. Lenders and borrowers were individually matched. Positions in Dharma were tokenized, but were not fungible (even if they had the same expiration date), making price discovery and liquidity provision more diﬃcult.\n\n3 Mechanism\n\nThis section describes the fyToken mechanism at a high level. For simplicity, this description assumes the existence of a synchronous free on-chain price oracle for the underlying asset. Section 5 discusses other constructions of fyTokens that do not depend on this assumption."

Anyone can deﬁne a particular fyToken by specifying those four parameters. For example, there would be one fyToken for a given USD oracle, backed by ETH, settling at 11:59 PM on December 31, 2019, with a 150% collateralization requirement. Applications will be somewhat incentivized to converge on focal points (i.e., by conventionally only buying or selling fyTokens that expire at the end of each quarter), to ensure that liquidity is not too fragmented. fyTokens that settle to synthetics or a ﬂoating-rate lending platform, as described in section 3.4, should mirror the parameters (such as collateralization requirement) used by the target platform.\n\nOne example of a fyToken might be “fyDAI/ETH (2021-01-01)”. This refers to a fyToken with DAI as the target asset, ETH as the collateral asset, expiring If referring generally to any fyToken that at 12:00 AM on January 1, 2020. targets DAI, we just use the term “fyDAI”.\n\nEach maturity of fyToken has its own ERC20 token contract. These con-\n\ntracts are initialized and tracked using a global registry contract.\n\n3.1 Minting fyTokens\n\nOnce a token contract exists for a particular fyToken, anyone can deposit collateral to create a vault. These vaults are analogous to (and named after) the vaults in the Maker system [9]. The owner of a vault can mint fyTokens, which adds to the vault’s debt. They can also burn fyTokens to reduce their debt. The debt of a particular vault must not exceed the value of its collateral plus some required margin, or it will be liquidated, as described in section 3.5.\n\nA fyToken resembles a secured zero-coupon2 bond. Upon expiration, it can be redeemed from the fyToken contract for its face value. fyTokens from diﬀerent vaults in the same token contract are fungible."

The purpose of the settlement mechanism is to ensure that fyTokens trade at the same price as the target assets at the moment of maturity.3\n\n3.2.1 Cash settlement\n\n“Cash settlement”—or, more precisely, settlement paid in the collateral as- set—is a settlement mechanism that depends on the existence of a precise price oracle for the price of the target asset in terms of the collateral asset.\n\nIn this mechanism, fyTokens can be redeemed for their face value as of the moment of maturity, with the redeemer receiving the appropriate amount of the collateral asset. Mechanically, as soon as a particular fyToken expires, anyone can call a function on the token contract that triggers settlement. That function calls the oracle to look up the current price of the target asset in terms of the collateral asset and stores it as the settlement price. After that point, anyone can redeem fyTokens for an equivalent amount of collateral, at the settlement price.\n\nAdditionally, after maturity, any vault owner can withdraw their collateral,\n\nminus the value of the outstanding debt as of the moment of maturity.\n\nThe advantage of this settlement mechanism is that it can support arbitrary target assets; the other settlement mechanisms described only support ERC20 assets. However, it requires a precise oracle for the price at the moment of settlement. Additionally, after the moment of settlement, fyToken prices begin to track the price of the collateral asset (since they are redeemable for a ﬁxed amount of that asset), rather than continuing to track the price of the target asset.\n\n3.3 Physical settlement through auction"

Suppose an expired vault has 1 ETH in collateral and 100 fyDAI in debt outstanding. The protocol would oﬀer anyone 0.01 ETH in exchange for 100 DAI, gradually raising that oﬀer over time until someone accepts.4 The remainder of the collateral would be returned to the vault creator, while the tokens collected in these auctions would be distributed to fyToken holders.5\n\n3It is also convenient for them to continue to trade close to the target asset after maturity, but this is not strictly required, and one of the mechanisms—cash settlement—does not achieve this goal.\n\n4The vault holder could short-circuit this process by either repaying their fyToken debt or\n\nby accepting the auction’s oﬀer themselves.\n\n5If the collateralization requirement was high enough that the vault does not become\n\n4\n\nOne advantage this mechanism has over cash settlement is that after this auction, assuming it is successful, each fyToken will be fully backed by the target asset, rather than being backed by some amount of the collateral asset.

            "text/markdown": "When the target asset for a fyToken is a collateralized synthetic asset like DAI, the fyToken can use the token’s own issuance mechanism for settlement. For example, when fyDAI backed by ETH matures, the protocol can move its ETH collateral into a Maker vault. As fyDAI holders show up to redeem their fyDAI, the protocol can borrow DAI from Maker and pay it out to the holders. As borrowers show up to pay oﬀ their debt, the protocol pays down any debt to Maker, and releases the borrower’s collateral back to them. Alternatively, the borrower may fork their collateral and debt oﬀ into their own Maker vault.\n\nWhen a fyToken matures, the protocol needs to charge borrowers a ﬂoating rate to keep the debt position open, to account for the stability fee that it may need to pay if it has to borrow DAI from Maker. Conversely, the protocol may begin to pay additional yield to fyToken holders at a ﬂoating rate.\n\nTherefore, another way of looking at this settlement mechanism is that users’\n\nﬁxed-rate fyToken positions are “rolled” into ﬂoating-rate debt at maturity.\n\nIn the example of fyDAI backed by ETH, at maturity the protocol could begin to charge borrowers the Maker stability fee on ETH, while paying lenders the Dai Savings Rate. This would guarantee that the protocol itself does not run a deﬁcit (assuming the Dai Savings Rate does not exceed the stability fee). A major advantage of this mechanism is that both borrowers and lenders can continue to keep the same positions open after maturity, with the only diﬀerence being that they are now paying ﬂoating-rate interest rather than ﬁxed.\n\n3.4.1 Settlement to borrowing platform\n\nMost ERC20 tokens cannot be minted simply by posting collateral. Never- theless, we can generalize from settling to a synthetic platform like Maker to settling to other platforms that allow users to borrow and lend the target asset against the same collateral asset."

If some of the collateral remains unsold when the auction is done, that collateral could be distributed to fyToken holders along with the physical assets.\n\n5\n\nuntil they repay their debt, and lenders would receive the Compound lending rate until they redeem their fyTokens for cTokens for that asset, which the protocol borrows from Compound as needed.\n\nIt follows that fyTokens may be settled to any other protocol that permits synthetic exposure to a target asset for collateral (whether by minting or bor- rowing it). As long as that exposure closely tracks the market price of the target asset after maturity, fyToken prices before maturity should reﬂect the true yield curve of the target/collateral asset pair.\n\n3.5 Liquidation\n\nIf the price of the collateral asset falls relative to the target asset before a fyToken expires, some of the vaults—and thus the fyTokens they back—may become undercollateralized. To protect against this, anyone can liquidate a vault that is too close to being undercollateralized.\n\nA vault can be liquidated if the value of its collateral (the current price of the target asset in terms of the collateral asset, P , times the quantity of collateral in that vault, C) is less than the value of its debt D adjusted for the collateralization requirement R: P · C < D · R.

When D < P · C < D · R for a particular vault, someone can collect a proﬁt by liquidating that vault. This also incentivizes borrowers to top up their vaults with additional collateral (or pay down debt) to avoid liquidation.\n\nFor example, suppose a vault for a fyToken with a collateralization require- ment of 150% has 1 ETH as collateral, and outstanding fyToken debt with a face value of 100 USD. If the price of ETH drops to $149, someone can liqui- date the vault by burning 100 fyUSD and receiving 1 ETH, for a total proﬁt of at least $49 (in fact a little more, assuming the fyUSD was trading at a dis- count). Alternatively, the collateral could be auctioned to repay, with the vault owner receiving some or all of whatever is left. This is similar to the liquidation mechanism used in Maker and Compound.\n\nIf the price drops so quickly that a vault goes from P ·C > D ·R to P ·C < D before anyone has a chance to liquidate it, it is possible for the system to become undercollateralized. In the above example, this would happen if the price of ETH fell from $150 to $99 before someone was able to proﬁtably liquidate it. This “gap risk” is one reason to set high collateralization requirements, especially when the backed asset or target asset is particularly volatile.\n\n4 Applications of fyTokens\n\nfyTokens are a low-level primitive, and they are not designed to be particu- larly friendly to end users. However, they could be used to construct interesting\n\n6\n\nproducts by composing them with other protocols or building human interfaces on top of them.\n\n4.1 Borrowing, lending, and leverage\n\nfyTokens enable a fungible market for ﬁxed-term secured lending on-chain. By minting, holding, and/or trading fyTokens, users can synthetically borrow and lend the target asset. Users are guaranteed a particular interest rate if they hold the position to maturity.\n\n4.1.1 Borrowing"

You might want to do this if you expect the target asset to fall in price (“shorting”), or if you expect the collateral asset to rise in price and want to increase your exposure to it (“leverage”).\n\nTraders can get additional leverage by trading the fyTokens for more of the collateral asset, depositing it into the vault, and taking out more fyTokens. This gives them greater long exposure to the collateral asset (and greater short exposure to the target asset), but increases their risk of getting liquidated. An application could abstract away this process for the user.\n\nThe protocol could also be designed to make leveraged trading more eﬃcient, by having a function that atomically mints fyTokens, sells them on Uniswap [10] for the collateral asset, and only then checks that the vault is suﬃciently collateralized (reverting the entire transaction if it is not).\n\n4.1.2 Lending\n\nBuying fyTokens is economically similar to lending the target asset. Because fyTokens are not redeemable until expiration, they are likely to trade at a dis- count until maturity, particularly if there is demand to borrow the target asset. This means the value of fyTokens (denominated in the target asset) will tend to appreciate over time as they approach maturity.

Alice looks up the USD/ETH fyToken contract that expires at the end of the quarter (on December 31, 2019) with a collateralization requirement of 150%.\n\nAlice creates a vault in that fyToken contract, deposits 1 ETH as collateral, and takes out 50 fyUSD as debt.

If the price of ETH gets too close to her liquidation price, Alice should try to close her vault or deposit more collateral to avoid paying this penalty.\n\nSuppose Alice holds the position until expiration. When it expires, $50 worth of her ETH collateral will go to fyToken holders, and the rest will go back to her.

This is simple if the contract has continuous access to a synchronous cheap price oracle that provides the price of the target asset in terms of the collateral asset. For some asset pairs, like ETHUSD, the contract may be able to piggyback on an existing oracle, like the one operated by Maker.7\n\nIf no such oracle exists, there are alternative ways of constructing the con-\n\ntract, as described below.\n\n5.0.1 What we need from our “price oracle”\n\nThe contract needs to learn something about the price of the target asset\n\n(in terms of the collateral asset) in the following cases:\n\nWhen fyTokens are minted, the protocol needs to know that the vault is\n\nfully collateralized.8\n\nWhen someone attempts to liquidate a vault, the protocol needs to know\n\nthat the position is undercollateralized.\n\nIf using the cash-settlement mechanism 3.2.1, when the fyToken is settled after expiration, the protocol needs to know the price of the target asset (in terms of the collateral).\n\nNote that for the ﬁrst two categories, (i.e., when determining whether some- one should be allowed to withdraw fyTokens, or determining whether a vault should be liquidated), the security of the system does not depend on an ex- tremely precise measurement, because you can trade oﬀ capital-eﬃciency for precision."

            "text/markdown": "For example, suppose you are only able to determine the relative price within a factor of 2. If you would otherwise have set the collateralization requirement to 150% (so a vault with $100 in debt would be liquidated when the collateral was worth $150), you can set the requirement to 300% instead, and give fyToken holders the same level of protection against gap risk. (vault creators would likely want to maintain at least 600% collateral, to avoid the risk of getting unfairly liquidated.)\n\n7If the fyToken is already using Maker as a settlement mechanism, as described in section\n\n3.4, then also using it as an oracle may not add signiﬁcant additional trust assumptions.\n\n8Such a check also needs to be done when removing collateral from a vault. However, removing collateral from a vault is economically equivalent to repaying the debt, closing the vault, opening a new vault with the reduced collateral amount, and taking out the same amount of debt. The same rules can therefore be applied to both cases, so we only describe the rules in terms of taking out additional debt.\n\n12\n\n5.0.2 Price oracles for on-chain assets\n\nIf the target asset is an ERC20 token, that could make it easier to create an oracle for it. There are many plausible ways to construct an imprecise relative price oracle for ERC20 tokens. One possibility is to use Uniswap v2’s TWAP accumulator as a price oracle [12].\n\nAnother possibility is to use an on-chain exchange that tracks the length of time that a particular oﬀer is open. A long-lived oﬀer to trade the target asset for the collateral asset can be used to infer a lower bound on the target asset’s price, and can therefore be used to liquidate a vault.\n\n5.0.3 Asynchronous or expensive price oracles\n\nIf the price oracle is asynchronous (like UMA’s Data Veriﬁcation Mechanism [15]), or expensive to use, it may be impractical to use it every time a vault is created or liquidated."

            "text/markdown": "There are some optimizations that could reduce the number of calls to the oracle (although they may require setting larger collateralization requirements to maintain the same level of safety). To sketch out some of them:\n\nWhen a vault is liquidated, instead of calling the price oracle, the liquida- tor could put up a security deposit. The vault’s owner can then cancel the liquidation and claim the security deposit by calling the oracle and proving that the vault was fully collateralized. If the liquidation has not been cancelled within 24 hours, the liquidation completes.\n\nWhen fyTokens are minted, the creator could either call the price oracle,\n\nor choose one of the following alternatives:\n\n– Point to an existing vault for the same fyToken with an equal or lower liquidation price, that is not in the process of being liquidated. The existence of such a vault implies that the liquidation price has not been reached.\n\n– Initiate a withdrawal of new fyTokens, then wait 24 hours. During that waiting period, anyone can initiate a liquidation of the position if it is undercollateralized (based on the post-withdrawal quantity of collateral). Once the waiting period is over, if no such liquidation is in progress, the withdrawal completes.\n\n6 Future work\n\nAs mentioned in section 4.2, there are likely some interest rate derivatives that could use fyToken prices as an oracle. These might be useful for expressing a view on the future path of interest rates, or for hedging duration while holding fyTokens or owning a vault.\n\nThe physical settlement system described in section 3.3 could likely be adapted to create Bitcoin futures on Ethereum, adapting ideas from Summa\n\n13\n\n[16] and tBTC [17] (such as using an SPV-proof-based orderbook for a price or- acle for proof of undercollateralization, and using SPV proofs to enforce physical settlement).\n\n7 Acknowledgments"

This gas cost is paid in Ether (ETH) and it directly affects the cost of your transactions on the Yield protocol.\n\nThe gas cost of a transaction is determined by the complexity of the operation. In the Yield protocol, different operations have different gas costs. For example, according to the document on gas costs, the operation of building, posting, and borrowing costs 326K gas, while repaying and removing collateral costs 305K gas.\n\nTo minimize the gas fees, you can consider the following:\n\n1. **Timing**: Gas prices can fluctuate based on network demand. If the network is busy, the gas price can go up. So, you might want to time your transactions when the network is less busy.\n\n2. **Batching Transactions**: If you have multiple operations to perform, you can batch them into a single transaction. This can sometimes save on the overall gas cost.\n\n3. **Gas Price Setting**: When you make a transaction, you can set the gas price you are willing to pay. If you set a higher gas price, your transaction will likely be processed faster. But if you are not in a hurry, you can set a lower gas price to save on fees. However, setting a gas price too low might result in your transaction not being processed.\n\nRemember that while you can take measures to minimize gas fees, the nature of the Ethereum network means that some level of gas fees are unavoidable. It's also important to note that the Yield v2 transactions are built dynamically for each request, and gas costs might vary by a small amount for each specific situation."

Execute the batch transactions on the tenderly fork of the Mainnet or Arbitrum. This is done by sending a set of encoded transactions to the Ladle via the `batch()` function. \n\n2. Add a call to `Assert.sol` (deployed at `0x40f0b18C7A41C04F848C033eD7F9178D9c5A80d8`) to the batch. This is typically done at the end of the batch. The purpose of this call is to check if the batch transaction meets an arbitrary expected outcome.\n\n3. If the assertion fails, the entire batch will also fail. This is a safety measure to ensure that incorrectly structured transaction sets do not 'succeed' without having the intended result.\n\n4. After executing the transactions, you can manually verify the state changes on the tenderly fork. This can be done by comparing the state before and after the execution of the transactions.\n\n5. The state changes can be seen on the tenderly fork. For Mainnet, you can use this link: [Mainnet tenderly fork](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/Yield/v2/fork/b6952bd3-a288-48c5-bf5c-7ed00a2a88ea). For Arbitrum, you can use this link: [Arbitrum tenderly fork](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/Yield/v2/fork/2c063048-b86a-4b52-95e1-77857426f54a).\n\n6. Look out for any discrepancies in the state changes. If the state changes do not match the expected outcome, it means that there is an error in the transactions.\n\nIn these verifications, you should be looking out for whether the state changes match the expected outcome. If they do not, it means that the transactions were not structured correctly or there was an error in the execution. The `Assert.sol` call is a crucial part of this process, as it allows you to check if the batch transaction meets the expected outcome. If the assertion fails, it means that the batch transaction did not have the intended result."

This change would allow the developer to propose and execute governance proposals, which could include emergency plans.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even with this change, developers would still not be able to approve governance proposals, register emergency plans, or restore permissions. These actions would still need to be performed by other roles within the Yield protocol's governance structure.\n\nIn terms of responding to emergencies, this change would allow the developer to propose and execute emergency plans, but the actual implementation of these plans would still need to be approved by the appropriate governance roles. This means that while the developer could respond quickly to emergencies by proposing plans, the actual execution of these plans could still be subject to delays depending on the governance approval process.\n\nIn summary, the proposed change would increase the developer's ability to respond to emergencies by allowing them to propose and execute plans, but it would not completely remove the need for governance approval, which could still potentially slow down the response to emergencies."

This migration is intended to provide several benefits to the users:\n\n1. **Simplified Rolling Process**: The Strategy v2 contracts simplify the rolling process. Rolling is the process of moving investments from one maturity series to another. This simplification can make it easier for users to manage their investments.\n\n2. **Emergency Mechanisms**: The v2 contracts include emergency mechanisms to exit an investment before maturity. This provides an additional layer of security for users, allowing them to withdraw their investments in case of unforeseen circumstances.\n\n3. **Investment in New Series**: After the migration, the funds will be invested in the Sept 2023 series. This can provide users with new investment opportunities.\n\nThe potential benefits of investing in the Sept 2023 series would depend on the specific terms of that series. However, in general, investing in a new series can provide opportunities for earning returns over a new time period.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual process of migration and investment in the new series is handled by the protocol, so users do not need to take any specific actions. The steps involved in this process are:\n\n1. Deploy new FYTokens and Non-tv pools.\n2. Deploy new Strategies.\n3. Governance proposal\n   i. Orchestrate contracts\n   ii. Add new series\n   iii. Add all ilks to the new series\n   iv. Migrate the funds from v1 strategies to v2 strategies\n   v. Invest the funds in the v2 strategies in the Sept 2023 series\n\nThese steps are executed by the protocol's governance mechanism."

This means that as an investor, you would have a more streamlined and efficient experience when rolling over your investments from one maturity date to another. This could potentially save you time and effort, and make the investment process more user-friendly.\n\n2. **Emergency Exit Mechanisms**: The new contracts include emergency mechanisms to exit an investment before maturity. This provides you with an additional layer of security and flexibility. In case of any unforeseen circumstances or changes in market conditions, you would have the option to exit your investment prematurely. This could influence your decision-making process by providing you with more control over your investments and reducing potential risks.\n\n3. **Automatic Rollover**: According to the Yield Protocol v2 documentation, when the liquidity pool’s maturity date is reached, strategies automatically rollover liquidity from one pool to a later pool and require no user intervention. This feature could make the investment process more convenient for you and could potentially influence your decision to invest in longer-term strategies.\n\n4. **Governance Involvement**: The introduction of new strategies and contracts often involves a governance proposal. As a part of the Yield Protocol community, you might have the opportunity to participate in these governance decisions, influencing the future direction of the protocol.\n\nRemember, while these features can enhance your investment experience, it's important to thoroughly understand the implications and risks associated with any investment strategy. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from financial professionals."

These changes will have significant implications for the governance process and the future direction of the protocol.\n\n1. **Deployment of new FYTokens and Non-tv pools**: The deployment of new FYTokens and Non-tv pools is a significant step in expanding the offerings of the Yield protocol. FYTokens represent fixed yield tokens that allow users to lock in a fixed interest rate for a specific period. The addition of new FYTokens and Non-tv pools will provide more options for users and potentially attract more participants to the protocol.\n\n2. **Deployment of new Strategies**: The deployment of new strategies is another important aspect of the proposal. These strategies are designed to simplify the rolling process and include emergency mechanisms to exit an investment before maturity. This will enhance the flexibility and security of the protocol, making it more attractive to users.\n\n3. **Governance proposal**: The governance proposal includes several steps such as orchestrating contracts, adding new series, adding all ilks to the new series, migrating the funds from v1 strategies to v2 strategies, and investing the funds in the v2 strategies in the Sept 2023 series. These steps will streamline the governance process and make it more efficient.\n\n4. **Future direction of the protocol**: The changes proposed in YPP-0111 indicate a future direction for the Yield protocol that focuses on expanding its offerings, enhancing flexibility and security, and streamlining the governance process. This will likely make the protocol more attractive to users and potentially lead to increased participation and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the changes proposed in YPP-0111 will have a significant impact on the governance process and the future direction of the Yield protocol. They represent a commitment to continuous improvement and growth, which is likely to benefit all participants in the protocol."

When a proposal like YPP-0111 is approved, the changes it proposes are coded into a smart contract, which is then deployed on the mainnet. \n\nThe \"mainnet\" is the primary public blockchain network where actual transactions take place and have real-world consequences. This is in contrast to test networks, or \"testnets\", which are used for testing purposes and where transactions don't carry real value.\n\nIn the case of Yield Protocol, the deployment to the mainnet would mean that the changes proposed in YPP-0111 are now live and affecting the protocol's operations on the Ethereum network. This could include changes to the protocol's rules, the introduction of new features, or other modifications.\n\nIt's important to note that before deployment to the mainnet, the changes are thoroughly tested on a mainnet fork. This is a replica of the mainnet used for testing purposes, ensuring that the changes work as expected without risking the actual assets on the mainnet. \n\nFor example, in the document titled \"YPP-0009\", it is mentioned that the changes have been tested on a mainnet fork before being deployed to the mainnet.

The proposal suggests setting the time stretch for the FYFRAX2309 series to `ONE64.div(secondsInOneYear.mul(45))`. This means that the liquidity of the pool would be stretched over a period of 45 years. This could potentially lead to a more stable pool with less price volatility. However, it could also mean that the pool might be less responsive to short-term changes in the market.\n\n2. **Sell Base to the Pool Fee (g1)**: The proposal suggests changing the sell base to the pool fee, denoted as `g1`, to 9000. This fee is charged when a user sells fyTokens to the pool. The higher the fee, the lower the price the user receives for the fyTokens they are selling. This could potentially decrease the returns for users who frequently sell fyTokens to the pool. However, it could also incentivize users to hold onto their fyTokens for longer, which could lead to higher long-term returns.\n\nIt's important to note that these changes are proposed to optimize the performance of the Yield protocol and to provide a better experience for its users. However, the actual impact on your experience and returns would depend on your specific usage of the protocol and market conditions."

            "text/markdown": "The constants and mappings included in YPP-0111 are crucial for understanding and interacting with the Yield protocol. Here's how they affect your understanding and usage of the protocol:\n\n1. **Series ID as Asset ID**: In Yield Protocol, each fyToken series is identified by a unique series ID, which is also used as the asset ID. This means that each series of fyTokens is treated as a distinct asset within the protocol. This is important for users to understand as it means that each series of fyTokens has its own unique properties and behaviors within the protocol.\n\n2. **Address Mappings for fyTokens, Pools, and Strategies**: These mappings provide the addresses of the smart contracts for the fyTokens, pools, and strategies used in the protocol. These addresses are crucial for interacting with these components of the protocol. For example, if you want to interact with a specific fyToken, you would need to know its contract address. Similarly, if you want to interact with a specific pool or strategy, you would need to know its contract address.\n\n3. **Time Stretch**: The time stretch is a parameter that is set in the PoolFactory prior to pool deployment. It affects the interest rate of the pool and thus the yield of the fyTokens. In YPP-0111, the time stretch for the FYFRAX2309 series is set to `ONE64.div(secondsInOneYear.mul(45))`. This means that the interest rate for this series is stretched over a period of 45 years, which would result in a lower annual interest rate.\n\n4. **Sell Base to the Pool Fee (g1)**: This parameter is set to 9000 in YPP-0111. This affects the fee that is charged when selling the base asset to the pool. Understanding this fee is important for users as it affects the returns they can expect when interacting with the pool.\n\n5. **Developer Address**: The developer address is the Ethereum address of the developer deploying the contracts. This is important for users to know as it provides transparency about who is deploying the contracts and allows users to verify the authenticity of the contracts.\n\nIn summary, these constants and mappings provide crucial information about the properties and behaviors of the fyTokens, pools, and strategies in the Yield protocol, and are necessary for users to understand and interact with the protocol."

Here's how each of them affects your interaction with the fyToken series:\n\n1. **Underlying Identifier**: This is a bytes6 tag that identifies the underlying asset for the fyToken series. The underlying asset is what the fyTokens can be redeemed for after the maturity date. For example, if the underlying asset is DAI, then the fyTokens can be redeemed for DAI.\n\n2. **Address for the Chi Oracle**: The Chi Oracle is a contract that provides the chi value, which is used to calculate the amount of underlying asset you receive when you redeem your fyTokens. The address for the Chi Oracle is needed to interact with this contract.\n\n3. **Address for the Related Join**: The Join contract is a holding contract for a specific type of collateral in the Yield protocol. The address for the related Join is needed to interact with this contract when adding or removing collateral.\n\n4. **Maturity in Unix Time**: This is the date and time when the fyToken series matures, expressed in Unix time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970). After this date, you can redeem your fyTokens for the underlying asset.\n\n5. **Name for the Series**: This is a human-readable name for the fyToken series. It doesn't affect your interaction with the fyToken series in a technical sense, but it can help you identify the series.\n\n6. **Symbol for the Series**: This is a short symbol for the fyToken series, similar to a stock ticker. Like the name, it doesn't affect your interaction with the fyToken series in a technical sense, but it can help you identify the series.\n\nHere's a code snippet from the document that shows how these parameters are used:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  addressFile: 'fyTokens.json',\n  name: FYFRAX2309,\n  contract: 'FYToken',\n  args: [\n    () => FRAX, // underlying identifier\n    () => protocol.getOrThrow(ACCUMULATOR), // address for the chi oracle\n    () => joins.getOrThrow(FRAX), // address for the related Join\n    () => EOSEP23, // maturity in unix time\n    () => 'FYFRAX2309', // name for the series\n    () => 'FYFRAX2309', // symbol for the series\n  ],\n  libs: {\n    SafeERC20Namer: protocol.getOrThrow(SAFE_ERC20_NAMER)!,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the underlying asset is FRAX, the Chi Oracle is ACCUMULATOR, the related Join is also FRAX, the maturity date is EOSEP23 (expressed in Unix time), and both the name and symbol for the series are 'FYFRAX2309'."

It is used to uniquely identify the pool.\n\n2. **Base Address**: This is the address of the base asset in the pool. The base asset is the asset that liquidity providers supply to the pool.\n\n3. **fyToken Address**: This is the address of the fyToken that the pool is associated with. fyTokens are ERC-20 tokens that represent a claim on a specific underlying asset that can be redeemed after a certain maturity date.\n\n4. **Time Stretch**: This is a parameter used to adjust the time sensitivity of the pool. It is represented in 64.64 fixed point format. The time stretch parameter can influence the pool's reaction to changes in interest rates over time. A higher time stretch value would make the pool more sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n\n5. **g1**: This is the fee charged when selling the base asset to the pool. It is represented as a fixed point number. This fee is proportional to both the interest rate and the time to maturity, ensuring that fees never result in an unreasonable amount on interest rates paid by borrowers (fyToken sellers) and earned by lenders (fyToken buyers).\n\nHere is a code snippet from the deployment of YieldSpace pools:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  addressFile: 'pools.json',\n  name: FYFRAX2309,\n  contract: 'PoolNonTv',\n  args: [\n    () => assets.getOrThrow(FRAX)!,\n    () => fyTokens().getOrThrow(FYFRAX2309)!,\n    () => timeStretch.get(FYFRAX2309)!.toString(),\n    () => g1.toString(),\n  ],\n  libs: {\n    YieldMath: protocol.getOrThrow(YIELDMATH)!,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a YieldSpace pool is being deployed with the identifier `FYFRAX2309`, the base asset is `FRAX`, the associated fyToken is `FYFRAX2309`, the time stretch is fetched from a map using the pool identifier, and `g1` is the fee for selling the base asset to the pool."

Here's a brief explanation of each:\n\n1. **Strategy Name**: This is a human-readable name for the strategy. It doesn't impact the functionality of the strategy, but it's used to identify the strategy in a more user-friendly way.\n\n2. **Strategy Identifier**: This is a unique identifier for the strategy. It's used to reference the strategy in the protocol's smart contracts. It's important to ensure this identifier is unique to avoid conflicts with other strategies.\n\n3. **Address for the Ladle**: The Ladle is the main contract in Yield Protocol v2 that users interact with. It handles operations such as borrowing, repaying, posting and withdrawing collateral, and more. The address for the Ladle is needed to link the strategy with the main protocol operations.\n\n4. **Address for the Underlying Asset**: This is the address of the token that the strategy will be using. It's important because it defines what asset the strategy will be dealing with.\n\n5. **Underlying Asset Identifier**: Similar to the strategy identifier, this is a unique identifier for the underlying asset. It's used to reference the asset in the protocol's smart contracts.\n\n6. **Address for the Underlying Asset Join**: In Yield Protocol, a Join contract is used for each type of collateral. The Join contract handles the logic for joining (depositing) and exiting (withdrawing) collateral. The address for the underlying asset join is needed to link the strategy with the correct Join contract for its underlying asset.\n\nThese parameters are set when the strategy is deployed and cannot be changed afterwards. They define the behavior of the strategy and how it interacts with the rest of the Yield Protocol. As a user, you don't need to worry about these parameters unless you're planning to deploy your own strategy. Instead, you would interact with the strategy through the Ladle contract, using the strategy identifier to specify which strategy you want to interact with."

These addresses are the Ethereum addresses of the deployed smart contracts for these components. \n\nAs a developer, you can interact with these smart contracts using the Ethereum library ethers.js. Here's a general step-by-step guide on how you can do this:\n\n1. **Import the ethers library**: You will need to import the ethers library in your JavaScript file.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ethers } from 'hardhat'\n```\n\n2. **Connect to the Ethereum network**: You can connect to the Ethereum network using an Ethereum provider. The provider allows you to send transactions and read data from the Ethereum network.\n\n```javascript\nconst provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider('mainnet');\n```\n\n3. **Create a contract instance**: You can create an instance of a smart contract using the ethers.Contract object. You will need the address of the smart contract and the ABI of the smart contract. The ABI is a JSON representation of the smart contract, including all its functions and events.\n\n```javascript\nconst contractAddress = '0xC7aE076086623ecEA2450e364C838916a043F9a8'; // Replace with the actual contract address\nconst contractABI = []; // Replace with the actual contract ABI\nconst contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider);\n```\n\n4. **Interact with the contract**: Once you have a contract instance, you can call the functions of the contract. For example, if the contract has a function `balanceOf`, you can call this function to get the balance of an address.\n\n```javascript\nconst balance = await contract.balanceOf('0xC7aE076086623ecEA2450e364C838916a043F9a8'); // Replace with the actual address\nconsole.log(balance);\n```\n\n5. **Create new financial products or services**: Depending on the specific financial product or service you want to create, you will need to interact with different smart contracts and call different functions. For example, you might need to interact with the fyTokens contract to create fixed yield tokens, or with the pools contract to create liquidity pools.\n\nRemember to replace the contract address and ABI with the actual values for the specific contract you want to interact with. The addresses for the different contracts can be found in the YPP-0111 proposal. The ABIs for the contracts can usually be found in the contract's source code or on the Ethereum blockchain."

The `oldStrategies` and `newStrategies` arrays are used to manage this transition. The `rollStrategies` constant is set to `oldStrategies`, indicating that these are the strategies that are due for a rollover.\n\n```javascript\nconst ysFRAX6MMSV1: Strategy_V1 = {\n  assetId: YSFRAX6MMS_V1,\n  address: strategyAddresses.getOrThrow(YSFRAX6MMS_V1)!,\n  base: frax,\n  seriesToInvest: ysFRAX6MMS,\n}\n\nexport const oldStrategies: Strategy_V1[] = [ysFRAX6MMSV1]\nexport const newStrategies: Strategy[] = [ysFRAX6MMS]\n\nexport const rollStrategies = oldStrategies\n```\n\nAs a user of the Yield Protocol, this change implies that the protocol is transitioning from the old strategy (`ysFRAX6MMSV1`) to a new strategy (`ysFRAX6MMS`). This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the maturity of the old strategy, changes in market conditions, or updates in the protocol's strategy algorithms.\n\nThe rollover process is designed to be seamless and does not require any user intervention. Your investment will automatically be transitioned to the new strategy. However, it's important to understand the details of the new strategy as it may have different risk and return characteristics compared to the old one.\n\nIn terms of your investment strategy, this change means that your investment will now follow the rules and potential returns of the new strategy (`ysFRAX6MMS`). You should review the details of this new strategy to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance."

This could potentially lead to better performance or additional functionality.\n2. **Improved Efficiency**: New strategies might be more efficient in terms of gas costs or yield generation, which could potentially lead to cost savings or increased returns.\n\nRisks:\n1. **Smart Contract Risk**: New strategies might have new smart contracts that have not been as thoroughly battle-tested as the old ones. This could potentially expose you to smart contract bugs or exploits.\n2. **Migration Risk**: The process of moving assets from one strategy to another might involve risks such as slippage or unfavorable market conditions.\n\nPlease refer to the specific documentation of the Yield Protocol for detailed information about the potential benefits and risks of rolling strategies."

This means you are investing 1,000,000 DAI or FRAX.\n- For USDC, '1000000' is converted into wei using 6 decimal places, as USDC uses a different standard. This means you are investing 1,000,000 USDC.\n\nThis information is important for your investment decision because it tells you how much of each asset you are investing. The choice of asset to invest in would depend on your investment strategy and the performance of these assets in the market. \n\nRemember that investing in cryptocurrencies involves risk, and you should only invest what you can afford to lose.

Each series corresponds to a single ERC-20 fyToken. For example, a user may own a vault with ETH collateral and debt in the September 25th, 2021 USDC series which represents an obligation to repay USDC on that date. The deployment of new fyToken series means that users have more options for borrowing and lending at fixed rates for specific terms. \n\n2. **YieldSpace Pools Deployment**: YieldSpace is an automated liquidity provider designed to enable efficient trading between fyTokens and their underlying assets. The deployment of new YieldSpace pools means that users have more options for providing liquidity and earning fees from future trades. YieldSpace pools improve on existing solutions by providing markets that quote at consistent interest rates over time, in the absence of trades. By quoting at a consistent interest rate, YieldSpace pools minimize losses from arbitrage. \n\nIn summary, the deployment of fyToken series and YieldSpace pools expands the options available to users for borrowing, lending, and providing liquidity, thereby enhancing the overall user experience on the Yield Protocol platform."

Here's how:\n\n1. **Underlying Identifier**: This is a bytes6 tag that identifies the underlying asset for the fyToken series. It is crucial for the correct operation of the protocol as it determines which asset the fyToken is tied to. Misconfiguration here could lead to incorrect asset tracking and potential loss of funds.\n\n2. **Address for the Chi Oracle**: The Chi Oracle is used to determine the redemption value of fyToken after maturity. It is important for the correct calculation of interest rates and the overall financial model of the protocol. If the address for the Chi Oracle is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect interest rate calculations and potential financial loss for users.\n\n3. **Address for the Related Join**: Join contracts hold ERC20 and other assets that are external to the Yield Protocol, but that are managed as collateral or underlying. The address for the related Join is important for the correct operation of the protocol as it determines where the assets for a particular fyToken series are stored. If this address is incorrect, it could lead to the loss of assets.\n\n4. **Maturity in Unix Time**: This parameter determines when the fyToken series matures. It is crucial for the correct operation of the protocol as it determines when users can redeem their fyTokens. If this parameter is incorrect, it could lead to users being unable to redeem their fyTokens at the correct time.\n\n5. **Name and Symbol for the Series**: These parameters are used for the identification of the fyToken series. While they do not directly affect the security of the protocol, incorrect configuration could lead to confusion for users.\n\n6. **Time Stretch**: This parameter is set in the PoolFactory prior to pool deployment and affects the sell base to the pool fee. It is important for the correct operation of the protocol as it determines the fee structure for the pool. Incorrect configuration could lead to incorrect fee calculations.\n\nIn summary, these parameters are crucial for the correct operation and security of the Yield Protocol. Incorrect configuration could lead to a variety of issues, including incorrect asset tracking, incorrect interest rate calculations, loss of assets, and incorrect fee calculations."

This scaling affects the shape of the YieldSpace curve, which in turn influences the interest rates and prices offered by the protocol.\n\nFor you as a user, the time stretch parameter can impact the returns you receive when providing liquidity, borrowing, or lending on the protocol. A higher time stretch value would make the YieldSpace curve less sensitive to changes in time, potentially leading to more stable returns over time. Conversely, a lower time stretch value would make the YieldSpace curve more sensitive to changes in time, which could lead to more variable returns.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the time stretch parameter is set by the protocol developers during the deployment of the YieldSpace pools and is not something that individual users can adjust. As a user, you can consider the time stretch value as one of the factors that contribute to the overall performance and return characteristics of the Yield Protocol."

This fyToken represents a debt obligation that matures in September 2309. The fyToken can be redeemed for the underlying asset (USDT in this case) after its maturity date.\n\nThe impact on your current investments would depend on your investment strategy. If you are currently invested in other series or fyTokens, the introduction of fyUSDT2309 provides you with another option for diversification. You could choose to invest in this new series if you believe it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that investing in a new series or fyToken comes with its own risks and rewards. You should carefully consider these factors before deciding to invest in the fyUSDT2309 series.\n\nIn addition, YPP-0111 also introduces a new roll strategy, ysUSDT6MMS. This strategy is based on the USDT stablecoin and is designed to invest in the fyUSDT2309 series. This could potentially provide another investment strategy for users who are interested in the fyUSDT2309 series.\n\nIn summary, the changes proposed in YPP-0111 provide more investment options for Yield Protocol users.

            "text/markdown": "The introduction of the new strategy `ysUSDT6MMS` in Yield Protocol would provide a new investment opportunity for you. This strategy is associated with the `fyUSDT2309` series, which is a fixed yield USDT series maturing in September 2023.\n\nHere's how it could affect your investment strategy:\n\n1. **New Investment Opportunity**: The `ysUSDT6MMS` strategy provides a new investment opportunity. You can choose to invest in this strategy if it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\n2. **Potential for Higher Returns**: Typically, new strategies are introduced to potentially provide higher returns compared to existing strategies. However, the actual returns would depend on various factors including market conditions and the performance of the underlying assets.\n\n3. **Diversification**: Investing in the new strategy could help diversify your investment portfolio, which can potentially reduce risk.\n\nHere are the steps you should take to adapt to this change:\n\n1. **Understand the New Strategy**: The first step is to understand the new strategy. You should review the details of the `ysUSDT6MMS` strategy and the `fyUSDT2309` series. Understand the potential risks and returns associated with this strategy.\n\n2. **Review Your Investment Goals**: Review your investment goals and risk tolerance. If the new strategy aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance, you can consider investing in it.\n\n3. **Decide on Investment Amount**: Decide on the amount you want to invest in the new strategy. It's generally a good idea to not invest all your funds in a single strategy, but to diversify across multiple strategies.\n\n4. **Invest in the New Strategy**: Once you have decided to invest in the new strategy, you can do so by interacting with the Yield Protocol smart contracts. You would need to call the appropriate functions to invest in the `ysUSDT6MMS` strategy.\n\nPlease note that while the introduction of new strategies can provide new investment opportunities, it's important to thoroughly understand these strategies and their associated risks before investing."

However, the specific details or implications of this deployment are not provided in the given context. \n\nIn general, a deployment in the context of a blockchain or Web3 project often involves the following steps:\n\n1. Writing the smart contract code, usually in a language like Solidity for Ethereum-based projects.\n2. Compiling the smart contract code into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n3. Deploying the compiled bytecode onto the blockchain network. This is done by sending a special kind of transaction that includes the bytecode as data.\n\nOnce a smart contract is deployed, it gets a unique address on the blockchain and its functions can be called by sending transactions to this address.\n\nIn the context of Yield Protocol, a deployment could involve deploying new versions of the protocol's smart contracts, deploying contracts to new networks (like Arbitrum, as mentioned in YPP-0072), or deploying fixes or upgrades to existing contracts.\n\nWithout more specific information from the document YPP-0111, it's hard to say exactly what the implications of the \"Deployment\" are. It could potentially affect the protocol's functionality, security, or compatibility with other systems or networks."

The time stretch values for FYETH2309, FYDAI2309, and FYUSDC2309 are set to be inversely proportional to 25, 45, and 55 years respectively.\n\nAs a user of the Yield protocol, the proposed time stretch changes in the PoolFactory would impact your experience when deploying a pool in the following ways:\n\n1. **Pricing Sensitivity**: The time stretch value affects the sensitivity of the pool's pricing curve to changes in time. A higher time stretch value would make the pool's pricing curve less sensitive to time changes, while a lower time stretch value would make it more sensitive. This means that the prices of the assets in the pool would change at different rates depending on the time stretch value.\n\n2. **Liquidity Provider Returns**: The time stretch value also affects the returns for liquidity providers. A higher time stretch value would result in lower returns for liquidity providers, while a lower time stretch value would result in higher returns. This is because the pool's fee, which is a source of returns for liquidity providers, is inversely proportional to the time stretch value.\n\n3. **Pool Deployment**: The time stretch value needs to be set in the PoolFactory before a pool can be deployed. This means that you would need to take into account the time stretch value when planning to deploy a pool.\n\nIn summary, the time stretch value is a key parameter that affects the behavior of a pool in the Yield protocol. As a user, you would need to understand its implications and take it into account when deploying a pool."

These values are calculated as `ONE64.div(secondsInOneYear.mul(25))`, `ONE64.div(secondsInOneYear.mul(45))`, and `ONE64.div(secondsInOneYear.mul(55))` respectively.\n\nThe time stretch value is a parameter that affects the pool's performance and potential returns. It is used to normalize the units for time so that the interest rate given by the formula is the four-year interest rate, rather than the annualized interest rate. This is done to maximize the useful liquidity in the pool.\n\nFor example, when interest rates are 0%, at least half of the Dai liquidity in the contract is reserved for providing liquidity at interest rates greater than 100%. If this represented annualized interest rates, that would be a lot of liquidity reserved for a relatively unlikely case. By normalizing the units for time, the contract ensures that the liquidity is used more efficiently.\n\nThe specific time stretch values for FYETH2309, FYDAI2309, and FYUSDC2309 would affect the pool's performance and your potential returns by influencing the distribution of liquidity in the pool. A higher time stretch value would reserve more liquidity for higher interest rates, potentially leading to higher returns in a high-interest-rate environment. Conversely, a lower time stretch value would reserve more liquidity for lower interest rates, potentially leading to higher returns in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual returns would also depend on other factors such as the overall market conditions, the demand and supply for the specific fyToken, and the pool fee (which is set as `g1` with a value of 9000 in the code)."

This fee is not charged in proportion to the amount being sold, but rather it is computed in \"yield space\" rather than \"price space\". This means that the fees impose some proportional spread on interest rates, rather than on prices.\n\nThe fee is used to adjust the interest rate downward, which effectively increases the price paid for the fyDai. If you are selling fyDai to the contract, the interest rate is raised to the power of `1/g1`, causing you to pay a higher interest rate (in other words, receive a lower price for the fyDai you are selling).\n\nFor example, if the pool's fyDai balance is 110, its Dai balance is 100, and `g1` is 0.95, then the unadjusted formula would give a marginal interest rate of 10%. The adjusted formula will give a marginal interest rate of approximately 9.47%.\n\nIn terms of impact on your trading costs and overall profitability, this fee structure could potentially increase your trading costs as you would be receiving a lower price for the fyDai you are selling. However, this fee is also used to incentivize liquidity providers to deposit tokens into the pool, which could potentially lead to better liquidity and more trading opportunities. \n\nAs always, the impact on your overall profitability would depend on a variety of factors, including the interest rates, the amount of fyDai you are trading, and the overall market conditions."

They are analogous to zero-coupon bonds in the sense that they do not pay interest but instead trade at a discount, rendering a profit at maturity when they are redeemed for their full face value. The interest rate is calculated by the difference between the discounted value and the underlying asset's value at maturity.\n\nIf you're heavily invested in ETH, DAI, or USDC, these new fyToken series provide you with the opportunity to lend these assets at a fixed rate. For example, if you hold FYDAI2309, you can redeem it for one DAI after the maturity date. \n\nMoreover, the deployment of new fyToken series also means the deployment of new YieldSpace pools. These pools allow you to provide liquidity and earn fees from other users looking to borrow and lend.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the deployment of new fyToken series doesn't necessarily mean you should change your investment strategy.

These pools are designed to enable efficient trading between fyTokens and their underlying assets, improving the liquidity of fyTokens. \n\nWhen you provide liquidity to these pools, you are essentially contributing to the efficient operation of the Yield Protocol. The parameters you mentioned - pool identifiers, base addresses, fyToken addresses, time stretches, and g1 parameters - are all essential components of these pools.\n\n1. **Pool Identifier**: This is usually matching the series (bytes6 tag). It helps in identifying the pool.\n\n2. **Base Address**: This is the address of the base asset in the pool. It's the token that liquidity providers supply to the pool.\n\n3. **fyToken Address**: This is the address of the fyToken in the pool. fyTokens are Yield Protocol's native tokens that represent a claim on a specific underlying asset that matures at a specific future date.\n\n4. **Time Stretch**: This parameter is used in the YieldSpace formula to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of the pool. It's a way to control how much the pool's balance changes in response to changes in interest rates.\n\n5. **g1 Parameter**: This is another parameter used in the YieldSpace formula. It's a way to control the curvature of the pool's balance in response to changes in interest rates.\n\nAs a liquidity provider, understanding these parameters can help you make informed decisions about which pools to provide liquidity to. For example, a pool with a longer time stretch might be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, potentially leading to higher returns (but also higher risk). Similarly, the g1 parameter can affect the pool's balance, which could impact your returns as a liquidity provider.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that providing liquidity to YieldSpace pools also involves risks, such as impermanent loss. This happens when the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. In Yield Protocol, an impermanent loss is relatively low as it happens only when interest rates change. Interest rates would have to move a lot to make impermanent loss significant. And, as long as you stay in the pool until maturity, you will get all your assets back plus more.\n\nIn conclusion, the deployment of the plain YieldSpace pools and their parameters play a significant role in your liquidity provision strategy. It's recommended to understand these parameters and the associated risks before providing liquidity."

If the YieldMath protocol fails to execute or throws an error during a transaction, it could lead to several potential issues:\n\n1. **Transaction Failure**: The most immediate effect would be the failure of the transaction you are trying to execute. This could be anything from adding liquidity to a pool, executing a strategy, or any other operation that relies on the YieldMath protocol.\n\n2. **Incorrect Calculations**: The YieldMath protocol is responsible for performing the necessary calculations for transactions. If it fails or throws an error, it could lead to incorrect calculations, which could affect the outcome of your transaction.\n\n3. **Potential Losses**: Depending on the nature of the transaction and the error, there could be potential losses. For example, if you're trying to add liquidity to a pool and the transaction fails, you might lose the opportunity to earn potential rewards.\n\n4. **Inability to Execute Strategies**: The YieldMath protocol is also used in the execution of strategies. If it fails, it could prevent the execution of these strategies, affecting your potential earnings.\n\n5. **Potential Security Risks**: In a worst-case scenario, if the YieldMath protocol fails or has a bug, it could potentially be exploited by malicious actors, leading to loss of funds.\n\nIt's important to note that these are potential issues and the actual impact would depend on the nature of the error or failure in the YieldMath protocol. The Yield Protocol team would likely work to resolve any issues as quickly as possible to minimize any potential impact on users."

These are fetched using the `assets.get()` and `fyTokens().getOrThrow()` functions respectively.\n\n```javascript\nargs: [\n  () => assets.get(DAI)!,\n  () => fyTokens().getOrThrow(FYDAI2309)!,\n  () => timeStretch.get(FYDAI2309)!.toString(),\n  () => g1.toString(),\n],\n```\n\n2. **YieldMath Library**: The `PoolNonTv` contract uses the YieldMath library for performing various calculations. The YieldMath library is fetched using the `protocol.getOrThrow(YIELDMATH)!` function.\n\n```javascript\nlibs: {\n  YieldMath: protocol.getOrThrow(YIELDMATH)!,\n},\n```\n\n3. **Time Stretch and g1**: The `PoolNonTv` contract also takes in the time stretch and g1 parameters for each pool. These parameters are fetched using the `timeStretch.get()` and `g1.toString()` functions respectively.\n\nBefore investing in these pools, you should understand how the Yield Protocol works, the risks involved, and the specific terms of the FYDAI2309 and FYUSDC2309 pools. It's also recommended to familiarize yourself with the `PoolNonTv` contract and the YieldMath library, as these are key components of the Yield Protocol's infrastructure."

They are designed to provide yield on the respective assets (ETH, DAI, and USDC) over a six-month period from March to September.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how these strategies work:\n\n1. **YSETH6MMS**: This strategy is designed for ETH. It involves deploying a 'Strategy' contract with the name 'Yield Strategy ETH 6M Mar Sep' and the identifier 'YSETH6MMS'. The fyToken used in this strategy is 'FYETH2309'.\n\n2. **YSDAI6MMS**: This strategy is designed for DAI. It involves deploying a 'Strategy' contract with the name 'Yield Strategy DAI 6M Mar Sep' and the identifier 'YSDAI6MMS'. The fyToken used in this strategy is 'FYDAI2309'.\n\n3. **YSUSDC6MMS**: This strategy is designed for USDC. It involves deploying a 'Strategy' contract with the name 'Yield Strategy USDC 6M Mar Sep' and the identifier 'YSUSDC6MMS'. The fyToken used in this strategy is 'FYUSDC2309'.\n\nEach of these strategies involves deploying a 'Strategy' contract with the respective parameters. The 'Strategy' contract is designed to manage the investment of the underlying asset in a specific fyToken, which represents a claim on the underlying asset plus interest that accrues over time until the fyToken's maturity date.\n\nAs for the potential risks and rewards, they are generally tied to the performance of the underlying asset and the interest rate environment. If the interest rates are high, the yield from these strategies could be significant. However, if the interest rates drop, the yield could be lower. Additionally, there is also the risk associated with the underlying asset's price volatility. For example, if the price of ETH drops significantly, the yield from the YSETH6MMS strategy could be negatively affected.\n\nIt's important to note that while these strategies can provide a yield, they are not without risk. Therefore, it's crucial to thoroughly understand these risks before implementing these strategies."

This could be on Discord, Telegram, or a dedicated forum on the protocol's website. Here, you can voice your opinions, ask questions, and engage in discussions about the proposal.\n\n2. **Vote on Proposals**: If you hold the protocol's governance token, you can vote on proposals. This is a direct way to influence the decision-making process. The specifics of how to vote will depend on the protocol.\n\n3. **Propose Changes**: If you have a strong opinion on a proposal and think you have a better idea, you can propose a change. This usually requires holding a certain amount of the protocol's governance token.\n\n4. **Engage on Social Media**: Sharing your thoughts on social media can also influence the discussion, especially if you have a large following. This can also help to bring more attention to the proposal.\n\nRemember, it's important to do your own research and understand the implications of the proposal before making a decision."

The `ysETH6MMS` strategy has an `assetId` and an `address` which are unique identifiers for the strategy. You can use these to interact with the strategy.\n\n```javascript\nconst ysETH6MMS: Strategy = {\n  assetId: YSETH6MMS,\n  address: strategyAddresses.getOrThrow(YSETH6MMS)!,\n  base: eth,\n  seriesToInvest: fyETH2309,\n}\n```\n\n2. The `base` field indicates that the base asset for this strategy is `eth` (Ethereum).\n\n3. The `seriesToInvest` field points to the `fyETH2309` series. This means that when you invest in the `ysETH6MMS` strategy, your funds will be used to invest in the `fyETH2309` series.\n\n```javascript\nconst fyETH2309: Series = {\n  seriesId: FYETH2309,\n  base: eth,\n  fyToken: {\n    assetId: FYETH2309,\n    address: fyTokens.getOrThrow(FYETH2309)!,\n  },\n  chiOracle: protocol.getOrThrow(ACCUMULATOR)!,\n  pool: {\n    assetId: FYETH2309,\n    address: pools.getOrThrow(FYETH2309)!,\n  },\n  ilks: ethIlks,\n}\n```\n\n4. The `fyETH2309` series has its own `fyToken` which represents the yield-bearing token for the series. When you invest in the `ysETH6MMS` strategy, you will receive `fyETH2309` tokens in return.\n\n5. The `fyETH2309` series also has a `pool` where liquidity providers can earn fees. By investing in the `ysETH6MMS` strategy, you indirectly provide liquidity to this pool and can earn a share of the fees.\n\nPotential Benefits:\n- By investing in the `ysETH6MMS` strategy, you can earn yield on your `eth` investment through the `fyETH2309` series.\n- You can earn a share of the fees generated by the `fyETH2309` pool.\n\nPotential Risks:\n- The value of the `fyETH2309` tokens you receive can fluctuate based on the performance of the underlying `eth` asset and the interest rate environment.\n- There is a risk of smart contract bugs or exploits which could lead to a loss of funds.\n- There is a risk of impermanent loss when providing liquidity to the `fyETH2309` pool.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified explanation and actual interaction with the Yield Protocol would require using a Web3 library like ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Always do your own research and consider your risk tolerance before investing."

The `ysDAI6MMS` strategy is specifically designed to invest in the `fyDAI2309` series as indicated in the code snippet from YPP-0111:\n\n```javascript\nconst ysDAI6MMS: Strategy = {\n  assetId: YSDAI6MMS,\n  address: strategyAddresses.getOrThrow(YSDAI6MMS)!,\n  base: dai,\n  seriesToInvest: fyDAI2309,\n}\n```\n\nHere are the steps to do so:\n\n1. **Approve the Strategy Contract**: First, you need to approve the `ysDAI6MMS` strategy contract to spend your DAI tokens. You can do this by calling the `approve` function on the DAI token contract with the address of the `ysDAI6MMS` strategy contract and the amount of DAI tokens you want to invest.\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming you have instantiated the DAI token contract and the ysDAI6MMS strategy contract\nawait daiContract.approve(ysDAI6MMS.address, amount);\n```\n\n2. **Invest in the Strategy**: After approving the strategy contract, you can now call the `invest` function on the `ysDAI6MMS` strategy contract with the amount of DAI tokens you want to invest.\n\n```javascript\n// The invest function will transfer the approved DAI tokens from your wallet to the strategy contract\nawait ysDAI6MMS.invest(amount);\n```\n\n3. **Monitor Your Investment**: Once your DAI tokens are invested in the `ysDAI6MMS` strategy, they will be automatically used to invest in the `fyDAI2309` series. You can monitor your investment by calling the `balanceOf` function on the `ysDAI6MMS` strategy contract with your wallet address.\n\n```javascript\n// This will return the amount of ysDAI6MMS tokens you own, which represent your share of the total DAI tokens invested in the fyDAI2309 series\nconst balance = await ysDAI6MMS.balanceOf(yourWalletAddress);\n```\n\nPlease note that you should replace `amount` and `yourWalletAddress` with the actual amount of DAI tokens you want to invest and your actual wallet address respectively. Also, these steps assume that you have a basic understanding of how to interact with Ethereum smart contracts. If you are not familiar with this, you may need to use a user-friendly interface or seek further assistance."

Here's a general step-by-step guide on how you could do this:\n\n1. **Approve the Strategy Contract**: First, you need to approve the ysUSDC6MMS strategy contract to spend your USDC tokens. This is a standard ERC20 operation and can be done by calling the `approve` function on the USDC token contract, passing in the address of the ysUSDC6MMS strategy contract and the amount you want to invest.\n\n2. **Invest in the Strategy**: After approving the strategy contract, you can invest in the strategy by calling the `invest` function on the ysUSDC6MMS strategy contract, passing in the amount of USDC you want to invest.\n\nPlease note that the actual function names and parameters might be different depending on the implementation of the Yield Protocol smart contracts. You should refer to the Yield Protocol's smart contract documentation or source code for the exact details.\n\nBefore investing, you should be aware of the following:\n\n- **Risk of Loss**: Investing in DeFi protocols always carries a risk of loss. Make sure you understand the risks associated with Yield Protocol and the specific series and strategy you are investing in.\n\n- **Understand the Strategy**: The ysUSDC6MMS strategy invests in the fyUSDC2309 series. Make sure you understand what this series represents. In general, a series in Yield Protocol represents a single borrowable asset with a defined maturity date.\n\n- **Check the Strategy Status**: Make sure the strategy is currently active and accepting investments. You can do this by checking the status of the strategy on the Yield Protocol interface or by calling the appropriate function on the strategy contract.\n\n- **Gas Fees**: Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts requires paying gas fees. Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover these fees.\n\n- **Slippage**: When investing in a strategy, there might be some slippage due to price changes between the time you initiate the transaction and when it gets mined. Be aware of this potential issue.\n\nRemember, always do your own research before investing in any DeFi protocol."

They could be using new mechanisms or algorithms that optimize the yield generation process.\n\n2. **New Features**: The new strategies might introduce new features or capabilities that were not present in the old strategies. This could range from support for new assets to integration with other protocols or platforms.\n\n3. **Migration**: Depending on how the protocol is handling the transition, you might need to migrate your assets from the old strategies to the new ones. This could involve unstaking your assets from the old strategies and then staking them in the new strategies.\n\n4. **Risk Profile**: The new strategies might have a different risk profile compared to the old ones. They could be more or less risky depending on the mechanisms they use for yield generation.\n\nPlease refer to the specific details of the proposal YPP-0111 or reach out to the Yield Protocol team for more specific information on the implications of this change."

This means that if you have invested in one of the old strategies (ysETH6MMSV1, ysDAI6MMSV1, ysUSDC6MMSV1), your investment would automatically roll over to the next pool when the maturity date is reached.\n\n2. **Investment Continuity**: The rollover feature ensures that your investment continues to earn returns without any need for manual intervention. This is particularly beneficial if you plan to stay invested in the Yield Protocol for a longer duration.\n\n3. **Investment Strategy**: Knowing that the roll strategies are the old strategies can help you plan your investment strategy. If you are satisfied with the performance of the old strategies, you can continue to invest in them knowing that they will automatically roll over. However, if you wish to switch to the new strategies (ysETH6MMS, ysDAI6MMS, ysUSDC6MMS), you would need to manually invest in them.\n\n4. **Risk Management**: Understanding the roll strategies can also help you manage your risk. If the old strategies have been performing well and are in line with your risk tolerance, you can continue to invest in them. However, if you find the new strategies to be more aligned with your risk profile, you may choose to switch.\n\nRemember, it's always important to thoroughly understand the investment strategies and their potential risks and returns before making any investment decisions."

This can have several implications for your trading strategies:\n\n1. **Predictability**: With fixed rate markets, the interest rate of the futures contract is known in advance. This can make it easier to plan your trading strategies as you have a clear understanding of the potential returns from the futures contract.\n\n2. **Risk Management**: Fixed rate markets can also help in managing risk. Since the interest rate is fixed, you are protected from fluctuations in the interest rate market. This can be particularly beneficial in volatile market conditions.\n\n3. **Strategic Opportunities**: The synthesis of expirable futures can also create strategic opportunities. For example, if you anticipate that the interest rates will fall in the future, you can lock in a higher rate today by entering into a futures contract.\n\nAs for the proposed changes in YPP-0112, they involve configuring series for Contango September 2023 instruments and updating CRs for Contango June 2023 instruments. This means that new futures contracts will be available for trading, and the collateral requirements for existing contracts will be updated. \n\nThese changes can impact your trading strategies in the following ways:\n\n1. **More Trading Opportunities**: The addition of new series for September 2023 instruments means that you will have more futures contracts to choose from. This can provide more opportunities for diversification and hedging.\n\n2. **Updated Collateral Requirements**: The update of CRs for June 2023 instruments may require you to adjust your positions. If the collateral requirements increase, you may need to add more collateral to your positions. Conversely, if the requirements decrease, you may be able to reduce your collateral and free up capital for other trades.\n\nRemember, it's important to carefully consider these changes and adjust your trading strategies accordingly."

The deployment of a new PoolOracle would mean that the platform is adding new price feeds, which could potentially be for new assets being added to the platform.\n\n2. **YieldSpaceMultiOracle**: This is another type of oracle contract that points to the PoolOracle. It is used to provide price information for multiple assets. The deployment of a new YieldSpaceMultiOracle would mean that the platform is expanding its multi-asset support, which would provide users with more options for borrowing and lending.\n\n3. **Joins**: These are contracts that handle the interaction between the Yield Protocol and the assets it supports. The deployment of new Joins would mean that the platform is adding support for new assets, which would provide users with more options for borrowing and lending.\n\nIn summary, these deployments would enhance your experience with the Yield Protocol by providing you with more options for borrowing and lending.

Increasing the debt ceiling for all instruments to $1M / 1000 ETH: This change would increase the maximum amount that can be borrowed using a particular instrument. This would allow for larger loans to be taken out, providing greater flexibility for borrowers.\n\nThese changes are designed to make the Yield protocol more flexible and accommodating for borrowers.

This means that your transactions on Yield Protocol via Arbitrum would be much cheaper.\n\n2. **Faster Transaction Speeds**: Arbitrum offers faster transaction confirmation times. This can make your experience with Yield Protocol smoother and more efficient.\n\n3. **Increased Accessibility**: With the deployment on Arbitrum, Yield Protocol is now accessible to a wider range of users. This can potentially lead to increased liquidity and better rates.\n\n4. **Asset Availability**: The deployment includes assets such as ETH, DAI, USDC, and USDT, with specific parameters for each, and expiries for EODEC22, EOMAR23, EOJUN23, EOSEP23. This provides more options for your transactions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that you would need to bridge your assets from Ethereum to Arbitrum to interact with the Yield Protocol on Arbitrum. This is a common step when using Layer 2 solutions and there are several bridges available for this purpose.\n\nIn summary, the deployment to Arbitrum mainnet is designed to enhance your experience with Yield Protocol by offering lower transaction costs and faster speeds.

This could potentially provide you with more opportunities for yield farming and other financial strategies.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that with the introduction of new series, there might be changes in the liquidity of existing series as some users might decide to move their funds to the new series. This could potentially impact the interest rates and the overall performance of the existing series. Therefore, you should carefully consider your financial strategies and risk tolerance when interacting with the new series."

This can allow you to find a series that best fits your financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\n2. **Potential for Higher Returns**: Each series has its own interest rate determined by the market rate from the appropriate liquidity pool. If a new series has a higher interest rate than existing series, you could potentially earn higher returns by lending your assets in this series.\n\n3. **Diversification**: By having multiple series available, you can diversify your investments across different series. This can help spread risk and potentially increase overall returns.\n\n4. **Flexibility**: Each series has a defined maturity date. This gives you the flexibility to choose a series that aligns with your investment timeline.\n\nRemember, while new series can provide more opportunities for earning returns, they also come with their own risks.

The `createSeries` function is called with a seed array of series as an argument. This seed array contains the initial data for each series that needs to be created.\n\n2. The function maps over the seed array, and for each series in the seed array, it creates a new series object.

This process is part of the setup and configuration of the protocol and is typically handled by the protocol's developers or administrators.\n\nHowever, the outcome of this process could indirectly affect your transactions.

            "text/markdown": "The creation of ilks and the determination of collateralisation ratio, initial discount, and duration are crucial factors that affect the value of your collateral and your potential yield in the Yield protocol.\n\n1. **Collateralisation Ratio**: This is the ratio of the total value of the collateral you have provided to the total debt you have taken on. The higher your collateralisation ratio, the lower your risk of liquidation. If the value of your collateral falls below a certain threshold (the collateralisation ratio), your collateral could be liquidated. Therefore, a higher collateralisation ratio provides more security but may limit your potential yield as it requires more collateral for the same amount of debt.\n\n2. **Initial Discount**: This is a factor that influences the price at which you can buy fyTokens, which represent your debt in the Yield protocol. A higher initial discount means you can buy fyTokens at a lower price, effectively giving you a higher yield when you repay your debt.\n\n3. **Duration**: This is the length of time until the fyToken matures. The longer the duration, the more interest can accrue, potentially leading to a higher yield. However, a longer duration also means your collateral is locked up for a longer period of time, which may not be desirable if you need liquidity.\n\nThe `createIlks` function in the Yield protocol is used to create ilks for each series. The function determines the collateralisation ratio, initial discount, and duration based on whether the asset pair is stable or not. For stable pairs, the collateralisation ratio is set to `1.026e6`, the initial discount to `1.01e6`, and the duration to `30`. For non-stable pairs, the collateralisation ratio and duration are determined by the base asset's `cr` and `300` respectively, and the initial discount is set to `1.05e6`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction createIlks(baseSeries: SeriesSeed): Ilk[] {\n  return SERIES_ARBITRUM.filter(\n    (ilkSeries) => ilkSeries.asset.bytes !== baseSeries.asset.bytes && ilkSeries.timestamp === baseSeries.timestamp\n  )\n    .map((ilkSeries) => {\n      const stablePair = ilkSeries.asset.stable && baseSeries.asset.stable\n      const vaultProportion = stablePair ? parseUnits('1') : parseUnits('0.5')\n      const collateralisationRatio = stablePair ? 1.026e6 : baseSeries.asset.cr\n      const initialDiscount = stablePair ? 1.01e6 : 1.05e6\n      const duration = stablePair ? 30 : 300\n      const collateralProportion = parseUnits((initialDiscount / collateralisationRatio).toString())\n\n      console.log(`Generating config for ${getName(baseSeries.bytes)}/${getName(ilkSeries.bytes)}`)\n```\n\nIn conclusion, the creation of ilks and the determination of collateralisation ratio, initial discount, and duration are important factors that influence the value of your collateral and your potential yield in the Yield protocol. You should carefully consider these factors when deciding how much collateral to provide and which series to participate in."

This function takes a `series` object as an argument, which contains properties such as 'asset', 'maxDebt', 'minDebt', and 'decimals'.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to use the `createSelfIlk` function:\n\n1. Prepare the `series` object. This object should contain the following properties:\n   - `asset`: This is the asset that will be used as collateral.\n   - `maxDebt`: This is the maximum amount of debt that can be issued against the asset.\n   - `minDebt`: This is the minimum amount of debt that can be issued against the asset.\n   - `decimals`: This is the number of decimal places for the asset.\n\n2. Call the `createSelfIlk` function with the `series` object as an argument.\n\nHere is a code snippet showing how to use the `createSelfIlk` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst series = {\n  asset: {\n    bytes: '0x...', // replace with the actual asset bytes\n    maxDebt: 1000, // replace with the actual max debt\n    minDebt: 10, // replace with the actual min debt\n    decimals: 18, // replace with the actual decimals\n  },\n};\n\nconst ilk = createSelfIlk(series);\n```\n\nThe `createSelfIlk` function creates an 'ilk' object with the following properties:\n\n- `collateralization`: This property is an object that contains the 'baseId', 'ilkId', 'oracle', and 'ratio'. The 'ratio' is set to 1e6, which means the collateralization ratio is 100%. This means that the value of the collateral should be equal to the value of the debt.\n\n- `debtLimits`: This property is an object that contains the 'baseId', 'ilkId', 'line', 'dust', and 'dec'. The 'line' is set to `series.asset.maxDebt * 10`, which means the maximum amount of debt that can be issued against the asset is 10 times the 'maxDebt' of the 'series' object. The 'dust' is set to 0, which means there is no minimum amount of debt that can be issued.\n\nPlease note that the 'collateralization' ratio and 'debtLimits' line are important parameters that determine the risk and liquidity of the 'ilk'. You should carefully consider these parameters based on the characteristics of the asset and the market conditions."

Here's a breakdown of the properties and how they affect your interactions with the protocol:\n\n1. `baseId`: This is the identifier for the base asset in the pair. The base asset is the one you would like to use as collateral. This affects your interaction with the protocol as it determines what asset you are depositing as collateral.\n\n2. `ilkId`: This is the identifier for the collateral asset. This affects your interaction with the protocol as it determines what asset you are borrowing.\n\n3. `asset`: This is an object that contains the `assetId` and `address` of the base asset. The `assetId` is the identifier for the asset, and the `address` is the Ethereum address of the asset. This affects your interaction with the protocol as it determines the specific asset you are dealing with.\n\n4. `collateralization`: This is an object that contains the `baseId`, `ilkId`, `oracle`, and `ratio` of the collateralization. The `oracle` is the price oracle used for the asset, and the `ratio` is the collateralization ratio. This affects your interaction with the protocol as it determines the amount of collateral you need to deposit relative to the amount you want to borrow.\n\n5. `debtLimits`: This is an object that contains the `baseId`, `ilkId`, `line`, `dust`, and `dec` of the debt limits. The `line` is the maximum amount of debt that can be created for this asset, the `dust` is the minimum amount of debt that can be created, and the `dec` is the number of decimal places for the asset. This affects your interaction with the protocol as it determines the range of debt you can create.\n\n6. `auctionLineAndLimit`: This is an object that contains the `baseId`, `ilkId`, `duration`, `vaultProportion`, `collateralProportion`, and `max` of the auction line and limit. The `duration` is the duration of the auction, the `vaultProportion` is the proportion of the vault that is auctioned off, the `collateralProportion` is the proportion of the collateral that is auctioned off, and the `max` is the maximum amount that can be auctioned off. This affects your interaction with the protocol as it determines the parameters of the auction in case of liquidation.\n\nIn summary, the 'ilk' object and its properties define the parameters of the collateralized debt position, which in turn determine how you interact with the Yield Protocol."

You can join these discussions, provide your insights, and ask questions.\n\n2. **Vote on Proposals**: If you hold governance tokens, you can vote on proposals. Your vote can influence whether a proposal is accepted or rejected.\n\n3. **Submit a Counter-Proposal**: If you disagree with a proposal, you can submit a counter-proposal. This allows you to suggest alternative solutions.\n\n4. **Engage with the Community**: Engage with the community on social media platforms. This can help you understand the sentiment of the community towards the proposal.\n\nRemember, your ability to contribute might depend on the specific governance model of the Yield protocol. Always check the official documentation or reach out to the community for specific instructions."

Once you're on the Tenderly dashboard, you can see the details of the fork where the testing was done. This includes the transactions that were executed, the contract calls, events emitted, and the state changes that occurred.\n\n3. You can click on each transaction to view its details. This includes the transaction hash, status, gas used, and the function calls that were made in the transaction. You can also see the state changes that occurred as a result of the transaction.\n\n4. To verify the results of the proposal execution, you can compare the state changes with the expected changes as per the proposal. This would require a good understanding of the Yield protocol's smart contracts and the changes proposed in YPP-0112.\n\n5. If the state changes match the expected changes, it means the proposal was executed successfully. If not, it indicates that there might have been an issue with the proposal execution.\n\nRemember that Tenderly is a blockchain simulation and debugging platform, and the results on a Tenderly fork might not always reflect the results on the live blockchain due to differences in the state of the blockchain at the time of testing."

The link to this dashboard should be provided in the YPP-0112 document. For example, in the context provided, the link is: https://dashboard.tenderly.co/Yield/v2-arbitrum/fork/5c70be65-97e6-4968-a087-a56818671606\n\n2. **Review the Transactions**: On the Tenderly dashboard, you can review the transactions that were executed as part of the testing for YPP-0112. This will give you an idea of what contract calls were made, what parameters were passed, and what the outcomes were.\n\n3. **Inspect Contract Calls and Events**: Tenderly allows you to inspect each contract call and event in detail. This can help you understand exactly what changes were made to the contract state, and how these changes affect the overall protocol.\n\n4. **Compare State Changes**: Tenderly also allows you to compare the state of the contract before and after each transaction. This can be very useful for understanding the impact of a particular proposal on the protocol.\n\n5. **Debug Transactions**: If a transaction fails, Tenderly provides debugging tools that can help you understand why it failed. This can be useful for identifying potential issues with a proposal.\n\nRemember, understanding the technical changes proposed in a YPP and their potential impact on the Yield protocol requires a good understanding of Ethereum smart contracts and the Yield protocol itself. If you're not already familiar with these, you may want to review the Yield protocol's documentation and codebase before diving into the Tenderly dashboard."

This deployment will have several effects on your current investments and future investment decisions:\n\n1. **Matured Series**: If you had funds in the matured March series, they will be moved to a new September series, simulating a strategy roll. This means your funds will continue to be invested and potentially earn returns, but in a different series.\n\n2. **June Series**: If you had investments in the June series, they will be duplicated on new contracts with a new series id, but otherwise identical to the old series. Your debt will be automatically migrated to the new June series with the same debt as you had. This means your investment position will remain the same, just on a new contract.\n\n3. **New Strategies**: The new June-December Strategies will be deployed at the same level as they were at the time of the Euler hack. This means that if you were benefiting from these strategies before the hack, you will be able to continue doing so.\n\n4. **Oracle Update**: All underlyings and fyToken will use the Accumulator Oracle for chi and rate, instead of relying on Compound for these values. This could potentially affect the returns on your investments, depending on the difference between the rates provided by the Accumulator Oracle and Compound.\n\n5. **Future Investment Decisions**: The deployment of the new strategies and series at the same level as they were at the time of the Euler hack means that the Yield protocol is aiming to maintain the same investment opportunities and potential returns for users. Therefore, if you were satisfied with these opportunities before the hack, you can expect similar opportunities going forward.\n\nRemember that while the Yield protocol is taking measures to recover from the Euler hack and maintain the same level of investment opportunities for users, it's always important to do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance when making investment decisions."

This invariant is a measure of the total liquidity in the pool and is designed to either increase or stay the same as the time to maturity decreases. This property of the invariant is a result of the derivative of the invariant with respect to time being less than or equal to 0 at all points.\n\nIn terms of optimizing your investment strategy in the Yield protocol, this property of the invariant can be used to inform your decisions on when to buy or sell fyDai. \n\nHere are some general strategies you could consider:\n\n1. **Buy fyDai when time to maturity is high**: Since the invariant increases or stays the same as time to maturity decreases, it could be beneficial to buy fyDai when the time to maturity is high. This is because the price of fyDai is likely to be lower when there is more time left until maturity.\n\n2. **Sell fyDai as time to maturity decreases**: As the time to maturity decreases, the invariant will increase or stay the same, which could lead to an increase in the price of fyDai. Therefore, it could be beneficial to sell your fyDai as the time to maturity decreases to potentially realize higher returns.\n\n3. **Monitor the pool's invariant**: The invariant of the YieldSpace pool can give you an indication of the overall liquidity in the pool. If the invariant is increasing, this could indicate that the pool's liquidity is increasing, which could lead to lower slippage when trading. Conversely, if the invariant is staying the same, this could indicate that the pool's liquidity is stable.\n\nRemember, these are just general strategies and the actual outcome will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and the specific parameters of the YieldSpace pool. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making investment decisions.",

The invariant is a mathematical formula that is used to determine the price of assets in the pool. \n\nThe invariant used in YieldSpace is the constant power sum invariant. This invariant has a property that the derivative of the invariant with respect to time is less than or equal to 0 at all points. This means that as time to maturity decreases, the invariant will either increase or stay the same. This property is important for managing assets in the Yield protocol as it ensures that the price of the assets in the pool will not decrease over time due to the passage of time alone.\n\nAs a web3 user, you can leverage this concept to manage your assets in the Yield protocol in the following ways:\n\n1. **Liquidity Provision**: You can provide liquidity to the YieldSpace pools. The invariant ensures that the price of the assets in the pool will not decrease over time due to the passage of time alone. This can provide a level of price stability for your assets.\n\n2. **Borrowing and Lending**: The Yield protocol allows you to borrow and lend assets. The invariant used in YieldSpace can impact the interest rates for borrowing and lending. Understanding the invariant can help you make informed decisions about when to borrow or lend assets.\n\n3. **Risk Management**: Understanding the invariant can also help you manage the risk of your assets. For example, if the time to maturity of your assets is decreasing, the invariant ensures that the price of your assets will not decrease, which can help you manage the risk of price depreciation.\n\nRemember that while the invariant provides some guarantees, it does not eliminate all risks. You should always do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance when managing your assets in the Yield protocol.",

This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and stability of the Yield Protocol system.\n\nIn a practical decentralized finance (DeFi) scenario, this condition could be applied in the following way:\n\nSuppose a user wants to borrow fyDai from the Yield Protocol. The user would need to provide collateral, and in return, they would receive fyDai. The amount of fyDai they receive is represented by 's' in the formula. The inaccessible fyDai, represented by 'y', is the amount of fyDai that cannot be accessed due to the constraints of the system, such as the collateralization requirement.\n\nThe condition ensures that the total supply of fyDai (s) that the user receives will always be greater than or equal to the amount of inaccessible fyDai (y). This is important because it ensures that the user will always have access to a sufficient amount of fyDai, regardless of the fluctuations in the DeFi market.\n\nIf this condition did not hold, it could lead to a situation where the user is unable to access their fyDai, which could disrupt their financial operations and potentially lead to a loss of funds.

This is a common mathematical technique used to simplify complex equations. The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms, and the logarithm of a power is the product of the power and the logarithm. This simplifies the equation to:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\ln \\left(x^{1-g t}+y^{1-g t}\\right)-\\ln 2}{1-g t} \\geq \\frac{\\ln \\left(x^{1-\\frac{t}{g}}+y^{1-\\frac{t}{g}}\\right)-\\ln 2}{1-\\frac{t}{g}}\n$$\n\nThe paper then takes the first derivative of this expression with respect to x. The derivative of a function gives the rate of change of the function at any point, and is used here to find the minimum of the function. The paper shows that when $x=y$, the left side of the equation is equal to 0, which means that this is a global minimum of the expression. \n\nBy showing that the derivative is 0 at the point where $x=y$, the paper proves that the total supply of shares will always be greater than or equal to the amount of inaccessible fyDai. This is because the derivative being 0 at this point means that the function has reached a minimum, and since the function represents the difference between the total supply of shares and the amount of inaccessible fyDai, this minimum must be greater than or equal to 0.",

            "text/markdown": "The concept of invariants, as discussed in the Yield Space paper, is used to derive a formula for a pooled liquidity provider for fyDai, called YieldSpace. This formula is based on a constant power sum invariant. \n\nThe invariant is a mathematical expression that remains constant even when other variables change. In the context of YieldSpace, the invariant is used to maintain a balance between the assets in the liquidity pool. \n\nTo apply this concept to optimize your yield farming strategies, you would need to understand how the invariant affects the interest rates and the liquidity in the pool. The invariant is designed to adjust the interest rates based on the liquidity in the pool, which in turn affects the yield that you can earn from farming.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can apply this:\n\n1. **Understand the invariant formula**: The invariant is derived from a mathematical expression that takes into account the interest rates and the time to maturity. Understanding this formula can help you predict how changes in these variables can affect the yield.\n\n2. **Monitor the liquidity pool**: The invariant is affected by the liquidity in the pool. By monitoring the liquidity, you can anticipate changes in the invariant and adjust your farming strategy accordingly.\n\n3. **Adjust your strategy based on interest rates**: The invariant also takes into account the interest rates. If the interest rates are high, it might be more profitable to lend your assets rather than farming them. Conversely, if the interest rates are low, farming might yield higher returns.\n\n4. **Consider the time to maturity**: The invariant formula also considers the time to maturity of the fyTokens. If the time to maturity is short, the yield might be lower. Therefore, you might want to farm assets with a longer time to maturity to maximize your returns.\n\nRemember, the goal is to maximize your returns while minimizing risk. Therefore, always consider the risk factors associated with yield farming, such as impermanent loss and smart contract risks, when applying these strategies.",

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can do this:\n\n1. **Implement the Invariant Formula**: The invariant is defined by the formula $y_{\\varnothing} = \\left(\\frac{x^{1-g t}+y^{1-g t}}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-g t}}$. This formula calculates the amount of inaccessible fyDai at any time. You would need to implement this formula in your smart contract to calculate $y_{\\varnothing}$.\n\n2. **Calculate the Derivative**: To ensure that $y_{\\varnothing} \\leq s$, you need to prove that the derivative of the expression is always greater than or equal to 0. The derivative is calculated using the formula $\\frac{t}{g} \\cdot y^{1+g t} \\cdot x^{\\frac{t}{g}-1}-g t \\cdot y^{1+\\frac{t}{g}} \\cdot x^{g t-1}$. This formula should be implemented in your smart contract to calculate the derivative.\n\n3. **Check the Conditions**: The derivative is only equal to 0 when $x=y$ (given that $g t-\\frac{t}{g} \\neq 0)$. Also, when $x=y, x>0$, and $0<t<g<1$ this second derivative is positive. These conditions indicate a minimum point, meaning that the expression is always greater than or equal to 0. You need to implement these conditions in your smart contract to ensure that $y_{\\varnothing} \\leq s$.\n\n4. **Maintain the Invariant**: Finally, you need to ensure that the invariant $y_{\\varnothing} \\leq s$ is maintained at all times. This can be done by implementing a check in your smart contract that verifies this condition after every transaction.\n\nRemember, these formulas and conditions need to be implemented in the smart contract of your decentralized finance application to ensure that the invariant $y_{\\varnothing} \\leq s$ is maintained. This will ensure that the total supply of shares will always be greater than or equal to the amount of inaccessible fyDai.",

This model is designed to reduce the market impact suffered by traders of fyToken, especially for fyToken that is closer to maturity.\n\nThe derivative of the function that models the market maker's behavior is only equal to 0 when $x=y$ (given that $g t-\\frac{t}{g} \\neq 0)$. This means that the market impact is minimized when the amount of fyDai sold is equal to the amount of Dai received. This is a key point for managing risk, as it allows you to predict the market impact of your trades and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nThe second derivative of the function is positive when $x=y, x>0$, and $0<t<g<1$. This indicates that the point where $x=y$ is a minimum point, meaning that the market impact is always greater than or equal to 0. This further reinforces the idea that the market impact is minimized when the amount of fyDai sold is equal to the amount of Dai received.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding these mathematical relationships can help you predict the market impact of your trades and manage your risk accordingly.
