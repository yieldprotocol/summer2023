Work by the Summer 2023 interns

## Overview
The internship project for Yield Inc. is to create an open-source LLM powered chatbot that is capable of answering Yield Protocol's user questions based on relevant documents from Yield's proprietary document corpus.
The workstream can be partitioned in 5 stages:
1.  Run a large language model on commercially available infrastructure. 
2.  Create a fine-tuning dataset that would assist Yield in achieving its goals. 
3.  Fine-tuning a large language model on the created dataset
4.  Comparing the fine-tuned model to publicly available foundation models 
5.  Deploy the RAG-LLM App to production.

The project's final product will be deployed to Yield Protocol's discord server as a beta release, collecting user data in order to facilitate further enhancement of Yield Chatbot and improve Yield Protocol's community to be more user-friendly.
